.Command box
image::command-box.png[width="800"]

// tag::command-syntax[]
=== Breaking Down the Command Syntax
Commands have the following format: `[red]#COMMAND_WORD# [blue]#-OPTION# [green]#PARAMETERS#` +

* The [red]`COMMAND_WORD` is the first word in the command
** It specifies *what you want to do*

* [blue]`OPTIONS` come after the [red]`COMMAND_WORD`
** They are prefixed with a dash (e.g. `-tag`)
** Provides more information on *how the action is to be performed*

* [green]`PARAMETERS` are the last segment of the command
** They provide the *information required to execute the action*

*Example*:

* `[red]#find# [blue]#-tag# [green]#friends#` can be understood as "[red]#find contacts# [blue]#with the tag# [green]#friends#"

// end::command-syntax[]
