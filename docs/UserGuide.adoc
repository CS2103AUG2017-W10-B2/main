that old classmate you haven’t spoke to in years have been up to? But perhaps you don’t really
want to talk to them right now. So, what do you do? You stalk their social media accounts!

and use it to view your contacts' social media feeds at any time.

.Command box
image::command-box.png[width="800"]

// tag::command-syntax[]
=== Breaking down the command syntax
Commands have the following format: `[red]#COMMAND_WORD# [blue]#-OPTION# [green]#PARAMETERS#` +

* The [red]`COMMAND_WORD` is the first word in the command
** It specifies *what you want to do*

* [blue]`OPTIONS` come after the [red]`COMMAND_WORD`
** They are prefixed with a dash (e.g. `-tag`)
** Provides more information on *how the action is to be performed*

* [green]`PARAMETERS` are the last segment of the command
** They provide the *information required to execute the action*

*Example*:

* `[red]#find# [blue]#-tag# [green]#friends#` can be understood as "[red]#find contacts# [blue]#with the tag# [green]#friends#"

// end::command-syntax[]

=== Representing a person as a parameter

When using commands that involve managing contact information, you may be required to enter information about a person as a `[blue]#PARAMETER#`.

== Features

=== Understanding command formats
In this user guide, you will find information about how commands are to be used explained in the form of *command formats*.

[NOTE]
====
* Parameters in *square brackets* are optional
